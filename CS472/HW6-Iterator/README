CS472 HW6 - Iterator & Visitor

To make our glyph classes more encapsulate we decided to use iterators to abstract the type of container holding our children. This was done through a list iterator (since internally all glyphs use an ArrayList). We also wanted a way to print out all the words in a document, this involved the use of iterator and the visitor pattern. We created a new pre order iterator that would traverse through each glyph in the document and created a Command called WordFinder that would actually visit each Glyph returned. We also used a concrete visitor called WordVisitor that would hold all the words during traversal. Once traversal ends the words are printed out to the console.
