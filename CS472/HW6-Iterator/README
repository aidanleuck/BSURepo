April 20 2022

This assignment uses the command and prototype pattern to implement user interaction on the Lexi window. There are two ways of interacting with commands, the first being via pressing a key. The available commands are increment font (i) decrement font (d), undo (u), and redo (r). You can also perform a command by clicking on buttons in Lexi. Any of the commands mentioned above can be tied to a button in addition to the set font size command. The Prototype pattern is used to create copies of our Commands to save them in a command history object so undo/redo can be implemented. Command history also uses the singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances from being created.

To Compile
$ javac **/*.java -d .

To Run:

$ java Main
