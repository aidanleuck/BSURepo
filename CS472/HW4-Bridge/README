Aidan Leuck
CS472 HW3 - Factory & Singleton

March 30 2021

This assignment makes use of the Factory and Singleton pattern in order to allow
A user to choose between two different looks and feels for two Glyphs, Button and Label.
By using the factory a user is able to create buttons and labels and choose the color,
based off an environment variable that is set. The singleton pattern is used to prevent
users from creating multiple instances of the factory throughout the program.

To Compile
javac **/*.java -d .

To Run:

With Green Look and Feel (Green is also default if no env variable is set):
export Feel="Green"; java Main

With Red Look and Feel:
export Feel="Red"; java Main
