This assignment makes use of the Factory, Singleton, and Bridge pattern to allow Lexi to swap different window implementations at run time. The client can set an environment variable in 
Order to choose between either AWT, or Swing. The Factory pattern is used to create instances 
of window implementations. Singleton pattern is used to ensure only one Window factory is created
Throughout the program at one time. The bridge pattern is used to allow us to aggregate both
Swing and AWT into a common interface as well as implement Glyph specific code on the left side of 
Bridge.

To Compile
javac **/*.java -d .

To Run:

With AWT 
export Window="Awt"; java Main

With Swing (Also default if no env variable set)
export Window="Swing"; java Main
