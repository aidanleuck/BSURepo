April 5 2021

This assignment uses a camera and a list to allow a user to snap a picture from their camera. Once a picture has been taken a small preview appears in the bottom right corner of the camera view. Additionally a picture and its associated thumbnail is appended to the list below the camera. A user can then choose to share, the image, delete the image, or save the image to their gallery.
